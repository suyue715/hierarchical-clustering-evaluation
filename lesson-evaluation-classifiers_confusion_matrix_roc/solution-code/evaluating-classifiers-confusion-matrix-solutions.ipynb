    "Sklearn's `metrics.classification_report` helps diagnose the effectiveness of your classifier. The report focuses on the precision, recall, and a metric known as the f1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The f1-score is the [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) of the precision and recall metrics. Blending the two is useful: precision measures how effectively the classifier performs when it is predicting a 1, whereas recall measures how many of the total 1 classes out of all the 1-labeled observations were predicted correctly. \n",

    "    - A precision score of 1 indicates that the classifier never mistakenly added observations from another class. A precision score of 0 would mean that the classifier misclassified every instance of the current class.\n",
    "- `Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`\n",
    "    - A recall score of 1 indicates that the classifier correctly predicted (found) all observations of the current class (by implication, no false negatives, or misclassifications of the current class). A recall score of 0 alternatively means that the classifier missed all observations of the current class.\n",
    "- `F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`\n",
    "    - The f1-score's best value is 1 and worst value is 0, like the precision and recall scores. It is a useful metric for taking into account both measures at once.\n",
    "- `Support` is simply the number of observations of the labelled class.\n",
    "\n",
